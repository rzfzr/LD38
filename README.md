# LD38

First LD, unfortunately i’m short on time and the project is going to stay like this for some time, I want to do more but it is playable, it does not have a name yet.

Uses only the arrow keys, somewhat inspired by the ‘grow’ games where the order of selection differ the result, but in real time

Game : <https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxY7-Pw7Nh5mUDI1Yjc1ekZrZXM/view?usp=sharing> (only windows for now)

Source : github.com/rzfzr/LD38 (I’ll add alot of details to the readme soon)

I had the idea, wrote all the code, modeled everything in SketchUp and the globe is the one from the announcing tweet. I’m entering it as Jam instead of Compo just because I don’t think it is polished enough.
